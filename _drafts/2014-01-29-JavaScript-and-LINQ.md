i still consider myself a beginner when it comes to programming in .NET languages[1]

[1]: You'll notice i call them ".NET languages" because at work i do a ton of vb.net programming, which makes some people's hair curl, but i don't think it deserves much derision. i do hate the lambda syntax when compared to C#, but i can get over the syntax to get to the power of the lambda.
