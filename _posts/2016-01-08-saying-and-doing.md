At work, i've been experiencing some hard drive issues in my main computer that i use for programming. So i spent a couple days trying to figure out what's wrong and what i should do to fix it.

Turns out i've misunderstood the way my computer has been working. i thought that Windows was running on my "blazing fast" hard drive (my SSD) but instead it was running on my much slower, much older (7 years old at this point?) hard drive. Fortunately, this has only been the case since i switched to Windows 10 at work (September/October 2015?), at which point i made a lot of sweeping computer changes.

i've been running around the office for years telling my co-workers that they're wasting their time running their operating system on slower hard drives and that once they switch to a solid-state drive, they'll never go back, yet i have not been doing that!

This whole incident has been a reminder that even though what i have been saying has been correct, that doesn't mean i've been doing it.
