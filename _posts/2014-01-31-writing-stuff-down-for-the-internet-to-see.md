title: Writing stuff down for the internet to see
---

## It's been a while

i mostly avoid publishing my thoughts online these days. As a programmer, i see a fiasco every other day about other programmers being jerks on the internet (OK, OK, it's not just programmers and i can see this happening every day everywhere), and even though i try really hard to not do that or be like that, i've made my mistakes and i don't want to contribute to that in any way.

It mostly boils down to me being afraid of messing up, which is something i'm working on.

Instead of being afraid of a mistake and not creating, i think i'll create and then choose to be honest when i do make a mistake. Then i'll do my best to fix it.

Anyway, i'm excited to have a home on the internet and be able to share what i'm working on and what i'm interested in. Because that's what the internet is for, right?

PS i wrote a bunch of this post and then read [Zach Holman's "Who Owns?"](http://zachholman.com/posts/who-owns/). It's great. i think a lot of what i'm saying here is contained there.
