title: There are many like it, but this one is mine
---

While writing the above line in [this site's readme file](https://github.com/jugglingnutcase/jugglingnutcase.github.io/blob/master/README.md), i looked up where it came from because i had no idea. Turns out it's originally about [a rifle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifleman's_Creed):

> This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

Even though i spend a lot of time writing software, i don't want to say that i will live and die upon the hill of this personal site being mastered, but it's time for me to move towards mastery, and not just on whatever this thing is.
