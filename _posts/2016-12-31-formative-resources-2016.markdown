* [On Being - David Whyte - THE CONVERSATIONAL NATURE OF REALITY](http://www.onbeing.org/program/david-whyte-the-conversational-nature-of-reality/8560) (highlights mine):

  > MR. WHYTE: Yes. Yes, that’s right. And there are many people in Syria now just trying to preserve their lives and the lives of their loved ones. So this has always been there and always been true. And who knows? Any of us could be precipitated into awful circumstances at any time. And many of us go through those dark years where you just feel as if it’s just the movement of your own — your own movement that’s just creating body heat to actually keep you alive.
  >
  > We go through those very, very narrow places. And John used to talk about how you shaped a more beautiful mind, and that it’s an actual discipline, no matter what circumstances you’re in. The way I interpreted it was the discipline of asking beautiful questions, and that a beautiful question shapes a beautiful mind. **And so the ability to ask beautiful questions, often in very unbeautiful moments, is one of the great disciplines of a human life. And a beautiful question starts to shape your identity as much by asking it as it does by having it answered.**
  >
  > And you don’t have to do anything about it. You just have to keep asking. And before you know it, you will find yourself actually shaping a different life, meeting different people, finding conversations that are leading you in those directions that you wouldn’t even have seen before.
  >
  > MS. TIPPETT: That’s what Rilke called “living the question.”
  >
  > MR. WHYTE: Exactly. Yeah. He’s always there before you. [laughs]
