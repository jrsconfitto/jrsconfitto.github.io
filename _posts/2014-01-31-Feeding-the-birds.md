title: Feeding the birds
---

The other weekend my wife and i went out to Mendon Ponds Park to feed birds. It was a ton of fun.

Besides being a great experience, i got some pictures and video that i got really excited about. My wife and i just got iPhones (my first smartphone ever) and the ability to do slow motion video is a trip:
